Project description:
C++ game for Windows;

Overall game description.
Third-person game. Starship flies from point A to point B, confronting enemies.
Starship constantly flies forward (independent of the player's will).
Player can strafe the starship left/right and up/down in the given area. 

Common architectural principals:
- All modules are written to be optimized for this project, and NOT for the general use;
- Project is NOT designed to be portable;
- Readability over performance;
- Less features for each module, make the essence of the product;

Directories:
1. GStar - the main project;
2. Source - Source code directory;
2.1. Source/Projects - All project files (except the main);
3. Out - Contains ANY output (from compiler, from UnitTests, logs etc);
3.1. Out/Exe - all executible files
3.2. Out/Lib - generated .lib files to be stored here;
3.3. Out/Test - logs generated by the unit-test apps;
3.4. Out/Log - logs from all apps of the project;
4. Data - Data for the application (levels, models etc.);
4.1 Data/Config - config files to the application.

Helper modules (typically getted from other projects):
Stores in the Source\Helper
1. Config - works with configuration, used by ANY module;
2. DependencyContainer - container to be used for dependency injection
(Should be used ONLY by the launch modules).

Library modules:
1. Core:
Basic type typedefs, Containers, Strings, Math, Loggging, Filesystem, Helper include files.
Used by any module;
2. ResourceBlobManager:
Loads resource byte blobs asynchronously;
3. RenderCore
Back-end render utils, shader compile utils etc.
Knows nothing about the render scene.
4. TextureManager;
Manages GPU memory for textures;
Knows how to convert the texture resource blob to a d3d11 real texture;
Uses ResourceManager  but abstracts from it;
4. MeshManager
Loads both static and skeletal meshes in native format from the mesh resources;
Defines the Mesh object internal representation;
Knows how to convert the mesh resource blobs into the internal mesh representation;
Uses ResourceManager  but abstracts from it;
5. SceneRender
Represents the render scene structure and renders it.
Uses RenderCore.
6. GUIRender
Stores and draws various primitives for UI rendering (Text, Buttons, Checkboxes, menus etc.).
Uses RenderCore.
7. GUIFramework
Used for rendering HUD and the main menu.
Uses GUIRender;
8. EngineWorld
Represents internal engine structure to store the world of the game (i.e. current loaded level);
Provides basic types of objects that can be stored in the game world.
And provides a way to create objects of the world.
9. EngineWorldLoader
Loads contents of the given world resource into the given engine world;
Uses EngineWorld, ResourceManager;
10. Engine
- Amalgamates all subsystems into a common framework;
- Basic game object framework;
- Stores current engine world;
- Processes collisions;
- Processes and dispatches input messages to other subsystems;
- Performs scene rendering (abstracts the concrete game from doing it);
- Performs UI rendering;
Uses Core, SceneRender, GUIFramework;
Typically, including this module should free you from any other dependencies of the game. 
11. GStarGameEngine
- Uses the Engine to implement all the GStar game logics;

Application modules:
1. GStar - amalgamates all libraries and launches, the game executible.

Tools modules:
Source/Tools contains various tools (for example, to import 3D models). 

Third-party dependencies:
1. Boost 1.67

Building:
Default repository path is considered to be C:/GStar.
If this's not the case, you may need to set the paths in the visual studio projects.

Project-settings:
1. Maximal count of settings is to be set on the level of All configs/All platforms  of the project.
2. Use relative paths when setting up library and header paths

Common project dependencies:
1. Third-parties:
1.1. Boost

Project directories:
1. Always include the Source directory into the directory paths;

Project output:
1. Prefix debug libraries with D

Project compilation settings:
1. /std:c++latest to use the latest C++ features.
